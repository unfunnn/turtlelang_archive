# turtlelang
An esolang where you control a turtle
## Usage
Each position the turtle is on has a different function, for example the top left is print

You move the turtle with ^, <, >, and v

Currently, only the first 7 positions have any function to them

You execute any function with the @ key, and quit executing it to move again with the . key

## Obligatory Hello World Program
>@Hello World.

Or if you want to make it more complex

>\>@greeting|Hello.<v@greeting.^@ world.
## Other examples
Cat program
> v>@userinp.<@userinp.

Adds two numbers together
>\>v@R1.@R2.>>^@var["R1"]+var["R2"].

Can you tell this is my first time using github
